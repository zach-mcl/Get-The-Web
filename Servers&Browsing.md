# Servers and Secure Web Browsing

A closer look at the servers that host and deliver web content and the importance of secure connections.

## Servers: The Powerhouses of the Internet
- Servers are powerful computers that store, process, and deliver web content.
- They respond to requests from browsers to access websites.

### Different Types of Servers
- **Web Server**: Stores web pages and media content.
- **Application Server**: Hosts and runs specific software applications.
- **Database Server**: Stores and manages data.

## Web Hosting
- Websites are hosted on servers, making them accessible over the internet.
- Hosting varies from shared environments to dedicated servers.

## The Importance of Secure Browsing
- Web security is vital to protect data and privacy.
- HTTPS (HTTP Secure) encrypts the connection between your browser and the server.

### How HTTPS Works
- Encrypts data sent and received, making it difficult for hackers to intercept.
- Uses SSL/TLS protocols for secure communication.

## The Role of Certificates
- Websites use SSL/TLS certificates to verify their identity.
- Browsers check these certificates to ensure a website's authenticity.
