# Servers and Secure Web Browsing

Learn about the role of servers in hosting web content and the importance of secure web browsing.

## Understanding Servers
- A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other computers over the internet.
- Types of servers include Web, Application, and Database servers.

## The Importance of Secure Browsing
- Secure browsing is crucial for protecting sensitive data.
- HTTPS encrypts data sent between your browser and the server.

## How These Components Work Together
- When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the server hosting the site.
- The server processes this request and sends back the data, which your browser then displays.
