# IP Addresses, DNS, and Browsers

Delving deeper into how the internet connects devices and how web browsers facilitate this connection.

## IP Addresses: The Internet's Addressing System
- Every device connected to the internet is assigned a unique IP address.
- IP addresses are like home addresses, guiding data to the correct destination.

### Static vs. Dynamic IP Addresses
- **Static IP Addresses**: Permanent and don't change. Often used by servers.
- **Dynamic IP Addresses**: Temporarily assigned by the network and can change.

## Domain Name System (DNS): The Internet's Phone Book
- DNS translates human-friendly domain names (like `www.example.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses.
- Without DNS, we would have to remember complex numerical addresses.

### How DNS Works
- When you enter a URL, your computer asks a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address.
- This process is like looking up a phone number in a phone book.

## Web Browsers: The Interface to the Web
- Browsers request, retrieve, and display web content from servers using the URL's IP address.
- They interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present user-friendly web pages.

### Popular Web Browsers
- Examples include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Each browser has unique features, but all serve the same basic purpose.
