# IP Addresses, DNS, and Browsers

Understanding IP addresses and DNS is crucial for grasping how the internet connects different devices.

## IP Addresses and DNS
- **IP Address**: A unique string of numbers separated by periods, assigned to each device connected to the internet.
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**: Translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses.

## How Browsers Use IP Addresses and DNS
- When you type a URL, the browser requests the IP address from a DNS server.
- The browser then uses the IP address to retrieve the website's data.

## Web Browsers: Our Gateway to the Internet
- Browsers interpret and display web pages from the data they receive.
- They support various web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
